# Time Sync Application
We have implemented a time sync application which allows users to:
* Create groups as admin
* Add members & jobs to groups
* Assign jobs to group members
* Work on an assigned job
* See working statistics in the form of a bar chart
* create meetings
* Vote for available time periods in each meeting
* See finalized available periods
